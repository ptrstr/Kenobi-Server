It's repo for the opensource version of Kenobi desktop app which works on Windows, Linux along side MacOS.

### Why is the desktop app opensource?
To help others who are struggling with writing code that commnunicates with between *desktop <=> iOS Devices*
> It is not limited to iOS devices (can be expanded to PWA, Android apps and even desktop apps)


### How does this work?
> Websockets!
